# 3x3_infinite_lattice

Runs a simulation of the basic TREAT fuel element in an infinite lattice configuration. This script creates a 3x3 lattice before
applying reflective boundary conditions. Set to be void axially. The results of this benchmark should be identical to the single
element infinite lattice. Run by executing the make_3x3_infinite_lattice.py script.
